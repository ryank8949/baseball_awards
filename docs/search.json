    "text": "1 Introduction\nMajor League Baseball, known as America’s pastime, was founded in 1903 (though professional baseball dates back to 1869). One of baseball’s distinguishing characteristics is its history of rich statistical analysis and recordkeeping. In fact, the application of statistical analysis to baseball has its own name: Sabermetrics. As statistical methodology and robustness of record-keeping has grown, so has the complexity under which players are evaluated. As a fan of baseball and the history of the sport, there have been times where I’ve noticed a dissonance between a player who seemed to perform the best and who actually won the award for a given year. I have wondered why the year-end voters made the decisions they did. What statistics were driving their selection criteria? Through exploratory analysis of player statistics and year-end awards (such as Most Valuable Player), I seek to understand how the definition of success in baseball has changed over time.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nTo obtain year-end awards data, I downloaded a dataset from the Lahman Baseball database. The Lahman Baseball database was created by SABR (Society for American Baseball Research) member Sean Lahman. It contains individual player and team stats per year from 1871 through 2024. This data is available in downloadable .csv files or as a downloadable SQL database. The awards dataset contains 12,462 rows and 6 columns. The dataset contains the standard awards of Most Valuable player, Cy Young, Gold Glove, and Rookie of the Year. Awards given out on a more frequent basis such as Player of the Week, and year-end awards that are more subsidiary such as the Outstanding DH Award, Reliever of the Year Award, and MLB Players Choice Outstanding Pitcher are also included in the dataset. The standard year-end awards of Most Valuable Player and Cy Young are of interest, so the dataset was filtered for these awards. The Most Valuable player (MVP) denotes the player which is deemed to have contributed the most to the success to their team. The Cy Young Award is similar, but is limited to pitchers. While rare, a pitcher is able to win MVP. To note, while all-star could be a powerful award for understanding player evaluation, it is not a year-end award so it was excluded.\nTo obtain player statistics, the pybaseball library was used. This library scrape Baseball Reference, Baseball Savant, and Fangraphs, all reliable MLB statistics websites. The data of interest are aggregate statistics per player, per year. There are many columns of data. In my analyses, I selected several variables based on the significance and notoriety of a given statistic. I pulled statistics from 1911 and onward, since the first MVP was awarded in 1911. The first Cy Young was awarded in 1956. To note, I used this package instead of obtaining data from the source websites because many of these sites have limited access or ability to download significant datasets easily. However, I still cited the relevant source websites in the bibliography. For most years of data, I filtered for players who had at least 300 plate appearances and filtered for pitchers who had at least 40 qualified innings pitched. For years where there was a shortened season, I lowered the threshold for qualified appearances in accordance with the number of games played in that season. For example, the pandemic-shortened season of 2020 was only 60 games long for each team, so I lowered the thresholds to 80 plate appearances and 5 innings pitched.\nData processing was done in Python. The processing presented a challenge. There was not a common player identifier between the awards dataset and the player statistics dataset. I ended up using a finding a separate file that exists for translation between baseball statistics datasets. The WAR (Wins Above Replacement) leader flag is a calculated variable. It took quite a bit of processing to properly process and merge the flag into the dataset, mainly because requisite data points for aggregation lived in different datasets. Even with this processing, the dataset was not fully complete, so I manually adjusted records that remained incomplete.\nLastly, pitchers who won MVP were excluded from the MVP/WAR analysis. The batter dataset and pitcher datasets are separate and were not easy to combine, so I left them separate. I believe that excluding pitchers from that analysis is okay because pitchers rarely win MVP. Since 1956, there have only been 11 pitchers to win MVP, out of 138 total.\nReferences\npybaseball.

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nFor each player, there are certain statistics which should always be present. Statistics such as name, games played, hits, home runs, batting average, strikeouts, and innings pitched should be complete. These represent some of the foundational metrics of baseball. There are also more advanced statistics created over time that incorporate these foundational metrics in formulas, such as OBP (on-base percentage) and SLG (slugging percentage). Since the oldest statistics can be referenced in these formulas, these metrics should be complete too. There are modern statistics that were introduced in 2015 with the implementation of Statcast, MLB’s advanced player and ball tracking system. These values, such as EV (exit velocity), LA (Launch Angle), and HardHit are missing for any records that predate 2015. This is because the technology to track these metrics was not implemented.\nWith the above said, I created the main dataset via a join into the awards database, which contains awards for both hitters and pitchers. As a result, there are pitchers and hitters that appear across datasets. A pitcher in the hitter dataset will have all N/A values and a hitter in the pitcher dataset will have all N/A values.\nThere were several MVP winners for which the WAR leader flag was not properly calculated (they displayed as NA instead of 0 or 1). I manually adjusted these records.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nmvp_df &lt;- read.csv('/Users/ryan/Desktop/STAT5702GR/final_project/mvp_hitting_dataset.csv')\nmvp_df_h &lt;- mvp_df %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(AVG)) # Filtering out pitchers in the MVP dataset\n\ncy_df &lt;- read.csv('/Users/ryan/Desktop/STAT5702GR/final_project/cy_young_pitching_dataset_rev.csv')\n\nhitting_df &lt;- read.csv('/Users/ryan/Desktop/STAT5702GR/final_project/hitting_dataset_all.csv')\npitching_df &lt;- read.csv('/Users/ryan/Desktop/STAT5702GR/final_project/pitching_dataset_all.csv')\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmissing_summary &lt;- hitting_df %&gt;%\n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ mean(is.na(.)))) %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"variable\", values_to = \"pct_missing\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(pct_missing))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(missing_summary, aes(x = pct_missing, y = reorder(variable, pct_missing))) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#1f78b4\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of Missing Values by Variable: Hitter Dataset\",\n    x = \"Percent Missing\",\n    y = \"Variable\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph shows that values are relatively uniformly missing.

    "text": "When it comes to comprehensively evaluating a player’s contributions, there is no statistic more referenced than wins above replacement (WAR). WAR uses a formula of several other statistics in an attempt to quantify a player’s total contribution to their team. A baseline value of WAR is 0, which represents a “replacement level player”. A replacement level player is a prototypical player who is easily acquirable and can be used to quickly replace other players. It is important to distinguish between a replacement level player and an average player. An average player in the MLB has a WAR above 0, coalescing around 2. WAR has been a mainstream statistic for a little over 10 years, and I am interested to see its impact on the awards voting over time.\n\n3.0.1 WAR Impact Question:\nHas the popularization of WAR impacted the frequency in which the player with the highest WAR wins Most Valuable player or Cy Young?\nTo note, there are two different calculations of WAR that are regularly referenced, bWAR and fWAR.

The 1990s and 2000s had a higher proportion of WAR-leading Cy Young winners than the 2010s and 2020s. While there are always star players, there were some all-time elite pitchers who were at their peaks during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, and Roger Clemens combined for 14 Cy Young awards between 1995 and 2004. These singular talents may have accumulated a relatively outsized WAR for a given season, which could be why the 1990s and 2000s have the highest proportion of WAR-leading Cy Young award winners.\nTo note, WAR leader is calculated within the population of pitchers only. The same applies for the hitter/MVP analysis above. Pitchers are not ranked against hitters and vice versa. Shohei Ohtani may be an exception, as he plays both pitcher and hitter.\n\n\n3.0.3 Individual Statistics\nWAR attempts to summarize the effectiveness of a player in a single metric, which on the surface is a very appealing statistic. It is now clear that voters have shifted their preferences or criteria for MVP voting. For Cy Young, this is still unclear. However, both MVP and Cy Young voting remain a holistic process, where voters consider a variety of statistics.\n\n\n3.0.4 Individual Statistics Question:\nWhich individual statistics are drivers of the MVP and Cy Young award, and how has this changed over time?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nhitting_era_df &lt;- hitting_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    decade_start = floor(yearID / 20) * 20,\n    decade_label = paste0(decade_start, \"s\"),\n\n    MVP_flag = ifelse(awardID == \"Most Valuable Player\",\n                      \"MVP Winner\",\n                      \"Non-MVP\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Build era + MVP flag dataset (if you haven't already)\nhitting_era_df &lt;- hitting_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    decade_start = floor(yearID / 20) * 20,\n    decade_label = paste0(decade_start, \"s\"),\n    MVP_flag = ifelse(awardID == \"Most Valuable Player\",\n                      \"MVP Winner\",\n                      \"Non-MVP\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(SLG.))   # drop rows without SLG_plus\n\nggplot(hitting_era_df,\n       aes(x = SLG., fill = MVP_flag, color = MVP_flag)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.35, linewidth = 0.9) +\n  facet_wrap(~ decade_label, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Non-MVP\" = \"gray70\", \"MVP Winner\" = \"#1f78b4\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Non-MVP\" = \"gray40\", \"MVP Winner\" = \"#084c8d\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"SLG+ Distributions for MVP Winners vs Non-MVP Hitters by Decade\",\n    subtitle = \"Bell curves show how slugging ability relates to MVP voting across eras\",\n    x = \"SLG+\",\n    y = \"Density\",\n    fill = \"MVP Status\",\n    color = \"MVP Status\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization attempts to show the density curves of Slugging Percentage+ for MVP winners vs non-MVP winners. Slugging Percentage attempts to measure a hitter’s power (i.e., the ability to get extra-base hits such as home runs and doubles). The “+” represents a normalization to 100 to represent the average for a given year, with adjustments for ballpark and for the league. As an example, a player with a Slugging Percentage+ of 125 has a 25% better slugging percentage than league-average for a given year. This is a powerful way to compare power relative to the rest of the league over time. The graph shows that through the 1930s, MVP winners often had a wide range of slugging percentage. This means that hitters who did not hit for power had a meaningful chance of winning MVP. Over time, the slugging percentage distributions for MVP winners narrowed while the rest of the league stayed fairly static, although this is expected for a stat that normalizes for historical average. By the 1980s, the distribution shows that it was unlikely that a player with a slugging percentage+ below 110 would be able to win MVP. By the 2020s, the distribution of MVP winners has shifted even more, with that boundary nearing 130. This graph shows that power has become a very important statistic for MVP consideration. Hitters like Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani come to mind, who have won multiple MVPs each for their impressive show of power.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# Stats you want to evaluate\ncandidate_stats &lt;- c(\"WAR\", \"AVG.\", \"SLG.\", \"wRC.\", \"ISO.\")\nstats_avail &lt;- intersect(candidate_stats, names(hitting_df))\n\n# Force period bins to start at 1900\nperiod_base &lt;- 1900\n\nranked &lt;- hitting_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    year_num = as.integer(yearID),\n\n    # FORCE 20-year bins starting at 1900\n    period_start = floor((year_num - period_base) / 20) * 20 + period_base,\n    period_end   = period_start + 19L,\n    period_label = paste0(period_start, \"–\", period_end),\n\n    # Rank players within league-year for each stat\n    # earlier code unchanged\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(yearID, lgID) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    across(\n      all_of(stats_avail),\n      ~ min_rank(desc(.x)),\n      .names = \"rank_{.col}\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmvp_ranked &lt;- ranked %&gt;%\n  filter(awardID == \"Most Valuable Player\")\n\nmvp_long &lt;- mvp_ranked %&gt;%\n  select(yearID, lgID, period_label, starts_with(\"rank_\")) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"rank_\"),\n    names_to = \"stat\",\n    values_to = \"rank\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    stat = sub(\"^rank_\", \"\", stat),\n    rank_bin = case_when(\n      rank == 1       ~ \"Top 1\",\n      rank &lt;= 3       ~ \"Top 3\",\n      rank &lt;= 5       ~ \"Top 5\",\n      TRUE            ~ \"Outside Top 5\"\n    ),\n    rank_bin = factor(rank_bin, levels = c(\"Top 1\", \"Top 3\", \"Top 5\", \"Outside Top 5\"))\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmvp_heat_period &lt;- mvp_long %&gt;%\n  group_by(period_label, stat, rank_bin) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n = n(), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(period_label, stat) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    total_mvp = sum(n),\n    pct = n / total_mvp\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(stat = factor(stat, levels = stats_avail))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nggplot(mvp_heat_period,\n       aes(x = stat, y = rank_bin, fill = pct)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    name = \"Share of MVPs\",\n    labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1),\n    low = \"white\",\n    high = \"#1f78b4\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"MVP Leaderboard Performance Across Baseball Eras\",\n    subtitle = \"20-year bins starting at 1900\",\n    x = \"Statistic\",\n    y = \"Ranking Bin\"\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ period_label, ncol = 2) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the earlier decades seem to be colored more homogenously than recent decades.

While wins are correlated with effecitve pitching, a lot of what happens in a game is outside of a pitcher’s control. The question I asked myself is, “As analytics have become more advanced, have wins had less meaning because they don’t correlate as strongly to pitcher performance as other statistics?” A great example is Paul Skenes’ record from this past season. As a pitcher on the Pirates, he pitched to a record of 10 wins and 10 losses. He won the Cy Young award even though he lost as many games as he won. The voters looked past the poor team performance that dragged down his win potential and rewarded Skenes for his outstanding numbers otherwise. I was surprised to see that wins are still a relatively strong predictor of the Cy Young award. Perhaps winning percentage correlate strongly enough with other meaningful pitching metrics that there isn’t much of a difference over time, even though wins may have less weight than they once did.",

    "text": "As many industries have made use of analytics in recent decades, baseball teams have devoted significant resources to analytics/sabermetrics departments. The “Moneyball” era ushered in a new era of player evaluation, increasingly driven by numbers and formulas. Awards voting has also evolved with time, with metrics like WAR showing a stronger correlation with MVP voting in recent years. As front offices have prioritized certain attributes, so have voters. Slugging Percentage+ is a strong example. As teams prioritize to drafting or signing of players who hit for power in recent decades, voters have mirrored this desire.\nThere are so many statistics that can be analyzed. A future direction of this project would be replication and expansion of current graphs and analyses to several other statistics. While I did not find a way to effectively incorporate Statcast statistics, I am very interested to see how these nascent metrics have correlated with awards voting. Expanding beyong awards voting, it would be fascinating to understand what metrics lead to draft picks and signings. For instance, which player statistics drive high salaries? Are there certain metrics that specific teams have rewarded more than others, and how has that worked out in terms of performance?\nOne of my main takeaways is that the data collection and processing can be much more nuanced than expected. While baseball statistics are comprehensive and generally widely available, they aren’t always easy to access in bulk. In addition, key attributes may be spread across disparate datasets that do not have common keys, making it difficult to reliably join datasets together.",
