    "text": "1 Introduction\nMajor League Baseball, known as America’s pastime, was founded in 1903 (though professional baseball dates back to 1869). One of baseball’s distinguishing characteristics is its history of rich statistical analysis and recordkeeping. In fact, the application of statistical analysis to baseball has its own name: Sabermetrics. As statistical methodology and robustness of record-keeping has grown, so has the complexity under which players are evaluated. As a fan of baseball and the history of the sport, there have been times where I’ve noticed a dissonance between a player who seemed to perform the best and who actually won the award for a given year. I have wondered why the year-end voters made the decisions they did. What statistics were driving their selection criteria? Through exploratory analysis of player statistics and year-end awards (such as Most Valuable Player), I seek to understand how the definition of success in baseball has changed over time.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nTo obtain year-end awards data, I downloaded a dataset from the Lahman Baseball database. The Lahman Baseball database was created by SABR (Society for American Baseball Research) member Sean Lahman. It contains individual player and team stats per year from 1871 through 2024. This data is available in downloadable .csv files or as a downloadable SQL database. The awards dataset contains 12,462 rows and 6 columns. The dataset contains the standard awards of Most Valuable player, Cy Young, Gold Glove, and Rookie of the Year. Awards given out on a more frequent basis such as Player of the Week, and year-end awards that are more subsidiary such as the Outstanding DH Award, Reliever of the Year Award, and MLB Players Choice Outstanding Pitcher are also included in the dataset. The standard year-end awards of Most Valuable Player and Cy Young are of interest, so the dataset was filtered for these awards. The Most Valuable player (MVP) denotes the player which is deemed to have contributed the most to the success to their team. The Cy Young Award is similar, but is limited to pitchers. While rare, a pitcher is able to win MVP. To note, while all-star could be a powerful award for understanding player evaluation, it is not a year-end award so it was excluded.\nTo obtain player statistics, the pybaseball library was used. This library scrape Baseball Reference, Baseball Savant, and Fangraphs, all reliable MLB statistics websites. The data of interest are aggregate statistics per player, per year. There are many columns of data. In my analyses, I selected several variables based on the significance and notoriety of a given statistic. I pulled statistics from 1911 and onward, since the first MVP was awarded in 1911. The first Cy Young was awarded in 1956. To note, I used this package instead of obtaining data from the source websites because many of these sites have limited access or ability to download significant datasets easily. However, I still cited the relevant source websites in the bibliography.\nReferences\npybaseball. (2023, September 8). pybaseball 2.2.7. PyPI.

    "text": "When it comes to comprehensively evaluating a player’s contributions, there is no stat more referenced than wins above replacement (WAR). WAR uses a formula of several other statistics in an attempts to quantify a player’s total contribution to their team. A baseline value of WAR is 0, which represents a “replacement level player”. A replacement level player is a prototypical player who is easily acquirable and can be used to easily replace other players. It is important to distinguish between a replacement level player and an average player. An average player in the MLB has a WAR above 0, coalescing around 2. WAR has been a mainstream stat for a little over 10 years, and I am interested to see its impact on the awards voting over time.\n\n3.0.1 Question:\nHas the popularization of WAR impacted the frequency in which the player with the highest WAR wins Most Valuable player or Cy Young?\nTo note, there are two different calculations of WAR that are regularly referenced, bWAR and fWAR. While the underlying formulas are different, the results of these calculations are often similar. The pybaseball package sources data from FanGraphs which uses fWAR.\n\n\n3.0.2 Importing Data\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmvp_df &lt;- read.csv('/Users/ryan/Desktop/STAT5702GR/final_project/mvp_hitting_dataset.csv')\nmvp_df_h &lt;- mvp_df %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(AVG))\n\ncy_df &lt;- read.csv('/Users/ryan/Desktop/STAT5702GR/final_project/cy_young_pitching_dataset_rev.csv')\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhead(mvp_df_h, 5)\n\n\n    X  playerID   bbrefID    full_name              awardID yearID lgID\n1   4 aaronha01 aaronha01   Hank Aaron Most Valuable Player   1957   NL\n2  40 abreujo02 abreujo02   Jose Abreu Most Valuable Player   2020   AL\n3  72 acunaro01 acunaro01 Ronald Acuña Most Valuable Player   2023   NL\n4 152 allendi01 allendi01   Dick Allen Most Valuable Player   1972   AL\n5 239 altuvjo01 altuvjo01  Jose Altuve Most Valuable Player   2017   AL\n  key_fangraphs  IDfg_x HR   AVG RBI  SO   OBP   SLG   OPS  wOBA wRC wRC.

However, I believe that the year range was much more limited for that graph, perhaps 2000-2017.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmvp_decade &lt;- mvp_df_h %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    decade_start = floor(yearID / 10) * 10,\n    decade_label = paste0(decade_start, \"s\"),\n    war_leader = case_when(\n      is.logical(WAR.leader.flag) ~ WAR.leader.flag,\n      TRUE ~ WAR.leader.flag %in% c(1, \"1\")\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(decade_start, decade_label) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    mvp_war_leaders = sum(war_leader, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_mvps = n(),\n    pct_war_leader = mvp_war_leaders / total_mvps,\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(decade_start)\n\nhead(mvp_decade, 5)\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  decade_start decade_label mvp_war_leaders total_mvps pct_war_leader\n         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         1910 1910s                      2          7          0.286\n2         1920 1920s                      4         11          0.364\n3         1930 1930s                      7         13          0.538\n4         1940 1940s                      8         16          0.5  \n5         1950 1950s                      6         17          0.353\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(mvp_decade, aes(x = factor(decade_label, levels = decade_label),\n                       y = pct_war_leader)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#1f78b4\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Percentage of MVPs Who Also Led Their League in WAR by Decade\",\n    x = \"Decade\",\n    y = \"Percentage\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph counts MVPs who also led their league in WAR and aggregates by decade.

The 1990s and 2000s had a higher proportion of WAR-leading Cy Young winners than the 2010s and 2020s. While there are always star players, there were some all-time elite pitchers who were at their peaks during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, and Roger Clemens combined for 14 Cy Young awards between 1995 and 2004. These singular talents may have accumulated a relatively outsized WAR for a given season, which could be why the 1990s and 2000s have the highest proportion of WAR-leading Cy Young award winners.\nTo note, WAR leader is calculated within the population of pitchers only. The same applies for the hitter/MVP analysis above. Pitchers are not ranked against hitters and vice versa. Shohei Ohtani may be an exception, as he plays both pitcher and hitter.\n\n\n3.0.3 Individual Statistics\nWAR attempts to summarize the effectiveness of a player in a single metric. However, MVP and Cy Young voting are a holistic process, where voters consider a variety of statistics.\n\n\n3.0.4 Question:\nWhich individual statistics are drivers of the MVP and Cy Young award?",
